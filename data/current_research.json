        "Ageing is a major risk factor for autoimmune disease and cancer, and significantly increases the risk of worse outcomes after infection. While great progress has been made in identifying the molecular correlates of ageing surprisingly little is known about how somatic mutations impact on immune cell function and interactions."
        "Somatic mutations are hard to study in healthy tissue, where they are much less common than in cancer genomes. However, single-cell omics can identify somatic mutations in individual cells. Broadly, single-cell omic profiling has revealed a bewildering diversity of cell types and states defined at the, genomic, mRNA and protein levels. We are now in the position to scale up these experiments to profile biological systems across large cohorts of volunteers and patients to understand how immune cell states are affected by our genetic make-up, including somatic mutations, and the environments that we live in as we age."
