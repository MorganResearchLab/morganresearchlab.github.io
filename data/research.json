            "In my previous appointment I developed a computational algorithm, called Milo, to identify perturbed cell states from single-cell experiments (Dann et al. Nature Biotech 2022). Milo uses a blend of graph theory (nearest-neighbour graphs) and statistical modelling (generalized linear models) to identify which cell states are enriched or depleted in an experiment. My lab continues to develop this framework to incorporate mixed effect models and employ graph-theory to improve the computational speed. Such advancements open the door to statistical genetic analyses of single cell data. My lab uses these computational advances to solve biomedical problems from basic research to disease - which broadens the impact of our research.",

            "I have recently developed an in vitro system to co-culture and stimulate peripheral immune system cells as a model of immune response and T cell:antigen presenting cell interactions. The motivation is to use this experimental system to probe how ageing and genetic variation shapes the way that immune cells communicate with each other to shape and direct proper immune responses. Using statistical genetics, we can then identify which genetic variants alter immune cell activation and cell-to-cell communication, and how this predisposes to a range of immune-related diseases, such as autoimmunity and cancer."
