        "content": "Our immune systems become less efficient as we get older, underpinning the increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease and poorer outcomes of infection compared to when we are younger. My lab studies how ageing and genetics alter the emergence and abundance of immune cell states in homeostasis and disease, and how the molecular hallmarks of ageing shape immune responses. Current focus on the lab is how ageing shapes T cell regulation, activation and responses to antigenic stimulation. By developing state of the art computational algorithms, we model variation in cell states and cell-cell interactions using single cell 'omics data modalities. This involves combining graph theory and statistical models to identify which cell types or interactions are perturbed by ageing and genetics. The impact of our research is broadened by the computational algorithms that we develop, and their application through collaborations with research groups that study cancer and immunology both nationally and internationally."
