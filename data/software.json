      "Milo performs statistical testing to identify differential cell state abundance in single-cell omics experiments. It leverages nearest-neighbour graph neighbourhoods to group transcriptionally similar cells across experimental samples.",
      "Hypothesis testing uses generalised linear and mixed effect models to identify which cell neighbourhoods (cell states) differ between experimental and study conditions.",      
      "For more details see our two papers on Milo under Publication. Milo is fully open-source and available through the Bioconductor repository:"

      "Single-cell sequencing has revolutionised biomedical research since its invention back in 2009. New technologies that use combinatorial barcoding to derive single cell transcriptomes have enabled researchers to performed bigger more complex experiments.",
      "However, current bioinformatics processing tools might not be making the most of the barcode data. We developed Scarecrow to allow both nucleotide mismatches and positional shifts in the position of cell barcodes from single cell sequencing libraries.",
      "Scarecrow is fast and scalable, and can improve useable sequencing read recovery up to 65%. Checkout the manuscript for more details: "
