        "Single-cell omic profiling has revealed a bewildering diversity of cell types and states defined at the mRNA and protein levels. We are now in the position to scale up these experiments to profile biological systems across large cohorts of volunteers and patients to understand how these cell states are affected by our genetic make-up and the environments that we live in. Moreover, by profiling complex compositions of cells using dissociated single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomic/proteomic approaches we can resolve how interactions between cells are regulated at the genetic level, how this manifests as cell-to-cell variability, and how this predisposes people to immune-mediated diseases."
