Moreover, by profiling complex compositions of cells using dissociated single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomic/proteomic approaches we can resolve how interactions between cells are regulated at the genetic level, how this manifests as cell-to-cell variability, and how this predisposes people to immune-mediated diseases."}]]}]}],["$","hr",null,{"className":"border-t border-gray-600 w-3/4 mx-auto mt-8"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col w-full","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col w-3/4 mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-right mt-8 text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold mb-4","children":"[Computational research]"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-justify text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl","children":["In my previous appointment I developed a computational algorithm, called Milo, to identify perturbed cell states from single-cell experiments (Dann et al.

My lab continues to develop this framework to incorporate mixed effect models and employ graph-theory to improve the computational speed. Such advancements open the door to statistical genetic analyses of single cell data.
